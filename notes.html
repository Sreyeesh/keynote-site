      <h2>Opening</h2>
      <p><strong>Start:</strong> "Good morning, everyone."</p>
      
      <p><strong>Key Message:</strong> "Game development is one of the most exciting creative industries. We create interactive worlds, characters, and systems that players explore and enjoy. But game development is also one of the most complex industries. Why? Because it brings together so many disciplines: programming, art, animation, sound, design, and narrative â€” all into one project. That's an incredible strength, but also a risk. Without structure, the project can collapse under its own weight."</p>
      
      <p><strong>Examples:</strong> "Think about it: how many times have you seen a build break minutes before a demo? Or nobody knows which version of an asset is the correct one? Or a project that runs beautifully on one computer but crashes on another? These are not problems of creativity. They are problems of workflow."</p>
      
      <blockquote>"Workflows are not bureaucracy. They are survival."</blockquote>
      
      <p><strong>Explain:</strong> "They are the invisible systems that let creativity flow without being crushed by disorder. When we implement them, the chaos of production becomes manageable, and the team can focus on what really matters: making a great game."</p>
      
      <p><strong>Preview:</strong> "Today, we're going to break down the technical workflows that keep projects healthy. I will walk you through the full pipeline: version control, build automation, asset management, testing, documentation, integration and release, scope management, and finally, technical art workflows. Each of these areas has its own purpose, and together they form the backbone of game production."</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Why Workflows Matter -->
    <div class="slide-notes">
      <div class="slide-number">Why Workflows Matter</div>
      <div class="timing">5 min</div>
      <h2>Why Workflows Matter</h2>
      <p><strong>Opening:</strong> "Let's begin by stepping back and asking: why do workflows matter at all?"</p>
      
      <p><strong>Context:</strong> "Game development is unique because of its complexity. It is not just code, like a software project. It is not just art, like a film. It is both â€” and more. It's interactive, it's systemic, and it evolves constantly during production. That means small problems can cascade into big ones very quickly."</p>
      
      <div class="key-points">
        <h4>Workflows Give Us Four Essential Things:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Every time we repeat a process, we want the same result. If one person exports a texture and it works, but another person exports the same texture and it breaks, that's wasted time. Workflows prevent this.</li>
          <li><strong>Traceability:</strong> In game dev, things change constantly. Without a record of who changed what and why, debugging becomes impossible. Workflows provide that history.</li>
          <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Multiple people need to work at once. An artist, a designer, and a programmer can't wait on each other. Workflows let them move in parallel without stepping on each other's toes.</li>
          <li><strong>Stability:</strong> At any moment, you should be able to click "Play" and get a working build. Workflows enforce that discipline.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Closing:</strong> "So when we say workflows matter, we're not talking about process for process' sake. We're talking about survival in a complex, multi-disciplinary environment."</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Source & Version Control -->
    <div class="slide-notes">
      <div class="slide-number">1. Source & Version Control</div>
      <div class="timing">7 min</div>
      <h2>1. Source & Version Control</h2>
      <p><strong>Opening:</strong> "The first building block of any workflow is version control. This is the system that records every change, who made it, and when. It allows us to branch, to merge, and to recover when mistakes happen."</p>
      
      <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> "Imagine dozens of people all contributing: artists committing models, designers committing levels, programmers committing code. Without version control, the 'latest' version is always on somebody's local machine. That's chaos. With version control, there's a single source of truth."</p>
      
      <div class="key-points">
        <h4>Detailed Lecture Points:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Always use a proper system: Git with Git LFS for large assets, Perforce for AAA-scale projects, or Plastic SCM for Unity-focused pipelines</li>
          <li>Choose a branching strategy: trunk-based for frequent merges and continuous integration, or feature-branching when isolation is needed</li>
          <li>Enforce commit messages that capture intent: explain <em>why</em> the change was made, not just <em>what</em> changed. This turns the history into documentation</li>
          <li>Tag builds in version control so that any shipped build can be recreated exactly</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Closing:</strong> "Without this foundation, every other workflow breaks. Version control is not just for safety â€” it is the enabler of collaboration."</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Build Pipelines -->
    <div class="slide-notes">
      <div class="slide-number">2. Build Pipelines</div>
      <div class="timing">7 min</div>
      <h2>2. Build Pipelines</h2>
      <p><strong>Opening:</strong> "If version control is the foundation, build pipelines are the machinery built on top of it. They transform source and assets into playable builds."</p>
      
      <div class="key-points">
        <h4>Why They Matter:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Manual builds are fragile. If they depend on one person knowing the exact steps, the project has a single point of failure</li>
          <li>Automated builds are reliable. Every change can be validated quickly</li>
          <li>Teams gain confidence: "if it built on the server, it will run on my machine"</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="key-points">
        <h4>Detailed Lecture Points:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Tools: Unity Cloud Build, Unreal Automation Tool (UAT), Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines</li>
          <li>Best practice: trigger builds automatically when commits are pushed or branches merged</li>
          <li>Integrate automated smoke tests: does the game launch, load, and run a basic scene?</li>
          <li>Archive artifacts: every build gets stored with its version, commit hash, and date. Rollback is always possible</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Closing:</strong> "Build pipelines make development continuous. They remove friction, detect issues early, and keep the project always playable."</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Asset Management -->
    <div class="slide-notes">
      <div class="slide-number">3. Asset Management</div>
      <div class="timing">7 min</div>
      <h2>3. Asset Management</h2>
      <p><strong>Opening:</strong> "Games are asset-heavy. 3D models, textures, animations, sounds, UI, shaders. Without rules, this turns into chaos fast."</p>
      
      <div class="key-points">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Assets are large and numerous. Without consistent naming, multiple versions creep in</li>
          <li>Inconsistent scale, pivots, or materials create endless bugs</li>
          <li>Large assets can break repositories or balloon builds</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="key-points">
        <h4>Detailed Lecture Points:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Establish strict naming conventions: e.g., <code>CHAR_Hero_Idle_v001.fbx</code></li>
          <li>Organize folder structures clearly: Characters, Environments, Audio, VFX</li>
          <li>Manage large files responsibly: Git LFS, Perforce depots, or asset servers</li>
          <li>Automate imports: Unity's AssetPostprocessor or Unreal's reimport rules enforce consistency at import</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>Engine-Specific:</h3>
      <p><strong>Unity:</strong> use Import Presets for textures and models; postprocessor scripts to fix scale and assign materials.</p>
      <p><strong>Unreal:</strong> enforce skeletons, compression, and LODs with import rules; use Derived Data Cache to speed iteration.</p>

      <p><strong>Closing:</strong> "This workflow ensures assets are engine-ready, consistent, and optimized."</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Testing Workflows -->
    <div class="slide-notes">
      <div class="slide-number">4. Testing Workflows</div>
      <div class="timing">7 min</div>
      <h2>4. Testing Workflows</h2>
      <p><strong>Opening:</strong> "Games are complex systems where one small change can break ten other things. Testing workflows protect against regression."</p>
      
      <div class="key-points">
        <h4>Why They Matter:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>They maintain confidence that builds remain stable</li>
          <li>They reduce the cost of fixing bugs by catching them early</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="key-points">
        <h4>Detailed Lecture Points:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Unit tests: check small, isolated systems</li>
          <li>Integration tests: validate subsystems working together</li>
          <li>Smoke tests: confirm the game launches and loads levels</li>
          <li>Performance tests: measure FPS, memory, load times on target hardware</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Closing:</strong> "When integrated with pipelines, testing workflows mean stability is continuous, not occasional."</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Documentation & Communication -->
    <div class="slide-notes">
      <div class="slide-number">5. Documentation & Communication</div>
      <div class="timing">7 min</div>
      <h2>5. Documentation & Communication</h2>
      <p><strong>Opening:</strong> "Workflows only matter if they are known and followed. That requires documentation and communication."</p>
      
      <div class="key-points">
        <h4>Why They Matter:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Without documentation, knowledge is siloed and disappears when people leave</li>
          <li>Without communication, teams drift, and integration suffers</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="key-points">
        <h4>Detailed Lecture Points:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep documentation lightweight but reliable. Tools: Notion, Confluence, HacknPlan</li>
          <li>Document <em>why</em> as well as <em>how</em>. The reasoning matters</li>
          <li>Connect repositories and build pipelines to Slack or Discord so everyone sees build statuses</li>
          <li>Auto-generate release notes and changelogs directly from commits</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Closing:</strong> "Documentation and communication workflows ensure knowledge is shared, aligned, and accessible."</p>

      <div class="timing">7 min</div>
      <h2>6. Integration & Release Workflow</h2>
      <p><strong>Opening:</strong> "Release is when workflows are tested most. Without strong workflows, it's chaos. With them, it's routine."</p>
      
      <div class="key-points">
        <h4>Why They Matter:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Release is high-risk: deadlines, visibility, and expectations</li>
          <li>Workflows reduce stress and increase confidence</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="key-points">
        <h4>Detailed Lecture Points:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Feature flags: incomplete features can be merged without breaking the build</li>
          <li>Release checklists: freeze, validate, package, distribute</li>
          <li>Daily integration builds: reduce merge conflicts</li>
          <li>Archive builds and configs for rollback</li>

      <div class="key-points">
        <h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
        <ul>

          <li>Use milestone stages: prototype â†’ vertical slice â†’ alpha â†’ beta â†’ launch</li>
